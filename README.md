<h1>Rolo</h1>
Roblox FPS Unlocker


<h2>Whats wrong with Axstin's FPS Unlocker</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker">Axstin's Roblox FPS Unlocker</a> is an amazing tool but I just didn't like having it open on startup and definitly not whenever I play Roblox. So being a programmer I decided why don't I just make my own, because thats what programmers do. So ROLO doesn't have to be open in the background. The only time you will have to run Rolo is if you updated Roblox.

<h2>Working with source code</h2>
Rolo was written in C# using Visual Studio 2022 with the .NET framework version 4.7.2
Everything inside the Rolo folder can be opened in Visual Studio for editing.
