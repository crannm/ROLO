<h1>Rolo</h1>
Roblox FPS Unlocker
<br><br>
⚠️ Important: Rolo will no longer be updated as Roblox now has official support for unlocking FPS.


<h2>Whats wrong with Axstin's FPS Unlocker</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker">Axstin's Roblox FPS Unlocker</a> is an amazing tool but I just didn't like having it open on startup and definitly not whenever I play Roblox. So being a programmer I decided why don't I just make my own, because thats what programmers do. So Rolo doesn't have to be open in the background. The only time you will have to run Rolo is if you updated Roblox.

<h2>Working with source code</h2>
Rolo was written in C# using Visual Studio 2022 with the .NET framework version 4.7.2
Everything inside the Rolo folder can be opened in Visual Studio for editing.

<h2>Virus Flagging</h2>
I understand that Rolo is being flagged by antivirus software, therefore I've included a virus total link so that you can see for yourself the legitimacy of the software. Feel free to do as much rooting through the source code as you want too. I've nothing to hide.
